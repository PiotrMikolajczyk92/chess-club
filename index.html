        <h2>Why is playing chess so beneficial?</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Connecting people</h3>
            <h4>Chess is one of the oldest games in the world, dating back more than 1500 years. As it spread around the world, chess evolved into the game we play today. Through this journey, people from different
            cultures, ages and backgrounds have come together with a common bond and passion for the game.</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Improve creativity</h3>
            <h4>It is said that a person's personality is revealed in his game of chess. A shy and passive person may play more
            conservatively, while a sociable and open person may be more daring in attack. The great thing about chess is that there
            is room for all styles and personalities. On the chessboard, everyone in their own way can show creativity by making
            different moves, devising plans and applying different tactical motives.</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Boost problem-solving skills</h3>
            <h4>In each game of chess, challenges and problems await us that must be solved in order to play the best game. Chess helps
            you think ahead, take your time with decisions, and weigh the pros and cons of your choices. Just like in chess, also in
            everyday life we try to make the best choices so that they bring positive results in our lives.</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Help to focus</h3>
            <h4>As Bobby Fischer said, "Chess requires total concentration." Each chess player can play like a grandmaster for 30 moves,
            and then in the 31st move he will be distracted and make an elementary mistake that will lose the game! Such intense
            concentration is also useful in everyday life, when you have to face household chores, daily duties and chasing
            deadlines.</h4>
